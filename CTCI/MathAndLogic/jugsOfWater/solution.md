# Problem

You have a five-quart jug, a 3-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly half of the jug would be impossible.

# Solution

5 + 3 = 8

Ok, so we start by filling up the 5.
Then we empty it on the 3.
Now we have two on the 5, and 3 on the 3
we empty the 3 back on the water source.
then we empty the 2 in the 3
we fill the 5 again
and from there, we fill the 3
that wait, we have 4 on 5, 3 on 3, and we completed the challenge.
