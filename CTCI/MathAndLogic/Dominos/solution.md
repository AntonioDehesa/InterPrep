# Problem
There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. 
You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly 2 squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board?
Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why its impossible)

# Solution
It is not possible. By deleting one square from two opposite corners, the dominos placement stretches to the next row, making it impossible to fit them all.
