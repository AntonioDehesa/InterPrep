# Problem

A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00 pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color, but they do not know their own (or is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does.
How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave? 

# Solution

if people = n, then evenings = n?
I mean, on a very quick thought, if we can see everyones eyes, but not our own, then we can see that no one else has blue eyes, but the order has not been completed. therefore, the only blue-eyed person left, is me, right?
